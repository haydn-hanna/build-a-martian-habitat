# build-a-martian-habitat
A quiz game where each correct answer means another piece of your habitat is built!

This is a simple javascript game for students learning about Mars during my Outschool lessons. The lesson is about website design - so most questions have to do with design decisions of websites. Each time a question is answered correctly, a piece of the habitat is printed onto the screen.

This project makes use of socket.io so that students can submit answers to a teacher for feedback. You can access the teacher dashboard by typing 'Teacher' into the 'name' field when you start the game. You can easily connect to a database if you'd like more robust usernames and passwords to access the teacher dashboard. 

This game also makes use of the ChatGPT API to provide teachers with quick options for giving feedback to student's written answers.
